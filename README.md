### Objective of the Project
Create a GitHub repository and a local repository.
This project uses a copy of a Python script created for the BikeShare project.
The data relates to bikeshare systems for three major cities in the United States â€” **Chicago, New York City, and Washingon**
This data computs descriptive statistics to compute the Most Popular Start Hour and Display a Breakdown of User Types.
We will make multiple branches and edits to files on those branches by updating a readme file and the Python code. 
Then we will commit the changes to the remote repository.
